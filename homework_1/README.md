# README For Homework 1
This folder `homework_1` is quite messy, but the core deliverables of the report and each problem set code are contained within.
The markdown text inside each `.ipynb` file (Problem1.ipynb, Problem2.ipynb, Problem3.ipynb) should be ignored, because they were being trialed for the final project.

## Environment
A Python 3.10 virtual environment (`.venv`) was created as the kernel of this code.
Code was developed in Visual Studio Code

## Run Instructions
Simply "run all" for each .ipynb.
The exception is for Assignment 1 part 3 (when all R1 R2 R3 radii are the same). For that, the radius should be manually changed before "run all".
Figures are automatically generated and saved in directories that are specific to this author's computer structure.

## General Comments
This code, while in public domain, should not be used by the public. It is messy and unsustainable and poorly structured with bad spaghettification.

But it works.
